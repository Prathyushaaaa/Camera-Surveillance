# Camera-Surveillance

**Human Detection and Limit Prediction using YOLO**

**Project Overview**: This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework in conjunction with Python and machine learning techniques to monitor the number of individuals passing through a specific point within a designated area, typically using camera surveillance.

**Objective**
The primary objective is to manage crowd density effectively, particularly in indoor spaces like halls or rooms, to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. By employing real-time monitoring and analysis, the system can alert authorities or designated personnel when the occupancy exceeds the predetermined capacity, thus facilitating proactive measures to ensure social distancing and safety protocols are upheld.

**Functionality and Usage**: The system operates by deploying YOLO for object detection, enabling accurate and efficient counting of people within a defined space. Implemented in Python, the project integrates machine learning algorithms to process video feeds in real-time, providing instant feedback on crowd density. Users can configure the system to set maximum occupancy thresholds for specific areas, triggering alerts whenever these limits are exceeded.
